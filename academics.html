	<p>The 2022-2023 year was a quick one if anything. As the school started I didnt really focus on school and put more focus on social life. But as the year went on I realizsed that I should focus on school more. So I put more time into it. All of my teachers were very supportive and kind throughout the year. It was a enjoyable school year.</p>
